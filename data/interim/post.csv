I used to work in theatre (lighting designer/electrician), an industry in which the visual presentation of your work is extremely important.

Also, during my two-year MA program, I read roughly a book per week per class, plus research for my thesis, so a minimum of 700 pages per week. I definitely came to prefer certain publishers over others because of the readability of their font choices. Garamond has been my favorite font for a little over two years now - when I write, I use Garamond, then change the font settings to Times New Roman (per submission standards) when I finish writing. So, in choosing fonts for this study, I knew I preferred serif fonts over sans serif, for the most part, and I typically prefer to read text with a comfortable bit of space between letters and between lines - but not too much, as it then becomes trickier for me to read and keep my thoughts together line to line.","It's perfect - Garamond has been my preferred font for a while now, and the majority of the text I produce is in Garamond.",5,Yes,5,5,"I think it looks elegant but is unobtrusive - aesthetically pleasing, but not distracting.
